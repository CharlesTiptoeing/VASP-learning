## What is density of state (DOS)

**One sentence defination**: The density of state (DOS) is the number of different states at a particular energy level that electrons are allowed to occupied(the number of electron states per unit volume per unit energy). **Application**: paramagnetic susceptibility, tranport phenomena of solids depend on this function, and determining the spacing between energy bands in semi-conductors.
